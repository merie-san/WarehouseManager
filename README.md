##To run the application:
Position yourself on the root directory of the project, create a data directory if it doesn't exists so the "data" files could be stored there. You can now run the application and play with it.

##To run the tests:
Create a directory "data" in the package you want to test and type "go test -v {path/to/package}". The test should run.
